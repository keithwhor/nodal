    Welcome to your Nodal Project, <b>{{= data.name }}</b>!
    <br><br>
    View the controller that renders this template to change the data sent to
    it, or modify the template directly.<br><br>
    We really recommend you start playing with creating RESTful API endpoints
    using the built in commands:<br>
<pre>nodal db:create
nodal db:prepare
nodal g:model --user
nodal g:controller v1 --for:user
nodal db:migrate</pre><br>
    To get a good feeling about how Nodal works and its intended use. :)<br>
    <b>Make sure you have Postgres installed, this.useDatabase and your
      database imports are uncommented in ./app/app.js, and your login
      credentials are correct!</b>
    <br><br>
    Query parameter ?test is equal to: {{! data.test }}<br>
    Try changing it in the address bar (add <i>?test=5</i> to the end
    of your url, for example)<br><br>
    Happy developing!
